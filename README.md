# TPV-scraper
This is a scraper for the Tennis en Padel Vlaanderen website. Its goal is to be a configurable scraper which can be used to, for example, look for availabilities, pull up historic data and perform analysis on said data.

## WIP
Currently working on the core functionality of the scraper: reading and interpreting the website correctly.
